# Hand-Hygiene-Monitoring-System-using-Gesture-Recognition 
A hand wash monitoring system to help maintain proper hand hygiene.Practicing hand hygiene is a simple yet effective way to prevent infections. Hospital staff tends to perform hand hygiene properly often only when they are aware that they are being observed. To track compliance, we aim to design a simple, cost‐effective solution easily reproducible on a mass scale which will in real time, monitor the entire process of hand washing.  
There are 8 steps recommended by WHO to maintain proper hygiene of hands.These 8 steps are described below:

In this project, we present a hand wash monitoring and reminder system that monitors hand hygiene by checking each and every step using gesture recognition and provides real time feedback,if any step is not done properly. Aim is to develop a working product that can differentiate hand wash gestures from other gestures with an high accuracy.Product must be robust, scalable, and easy to install, and it over‐comes most of the problems of existing related systems.   
Image processing along with deep learning is used to train the a neural network model on the 8 steps.
In the same way 8 steps of hand hygiene were trained.This project is under training stage currently.  
The current epidemic of the novel Covid-19 makes it essential for everyone to wash their hands properly as shown in the image above. 
Currently the system uses MobileNetV2 on tensorflow back-end for keras. It manages to classify the 8 different steps with close to 70% accuracy.
